/// Computes the primary axes to test for a Separating Axis Theorem (SAT) collision
/// between rectangles in 2D space.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `body`: A reference to a `RigidBody` representing a rectangle. The function
///   assumes the `RigidBody` is of type `Rectangle`; if not, it will panic.
///
/// # Returns
/// - A 2x3 array containing two normalized axis vectors (in 3D form) perpendicular
///   to the rectangle's edges. These axes are necessary for performing SAT-based
///   collision detection.
///
/// # Details
/// This function calculates the two primary axes of separation for the given rectangle,
/// which are based on its rotated edges. The rotation is applied around the Z-axis using
/// the body's `rotation` property.
///
/// - First, the function determines the rectangle's `width` and `height` and then finds
///   three of its corner points in world space (top-left, top-right, and bottom-right),
///   accounting for rotation.
/// - The edge vectors `axis1` (bottom-right to top-right) and `axis2` (top-right to
///   top-left) are computed, and then the perpendicular (normal) vectors for each axis
///   are derived to obtain the directions to test for separation.
/// - Finally, both perpendicular vectors are normalized, ensuring that they are unit
///   vectors suitable for projection in SAT testing.
///
/// # Panics
/// - Panics if the `RigidBody` is not of type `Rectangle`.
///
/// # Usage
/// This function is used primarily in collision detection algorithms where SAT
/// is employed to determine if two rectangles are intersecting. The returned axes
/// are used to project both rectangles and check for overlap, allowing for precise
/// collision determination.

///
/// # Details
/// This function utilizes the rectangle's corners, which are computed by the `corners`

///
/// # Details
/// In the context of SAT-based collision detection, each shape's projection onto

/// - `proj_b`: A reference to a `Projection` representing the minimum and maximum

///
/// # Returns
/// - A `f32` value representing the distance of the overlap between `proj_a` and

///
/// # Details
/// In SAT collision detection, if two shapes are overlapping along all axes, the
